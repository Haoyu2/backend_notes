# 1 What is denomalization? and compare it with nomalization.
  Denormalization is the inverse process of normalization where the redundancy is added to the data intentionally to improve the performance of the specific application and data integrity. The reason for performing denormalization is the overheads produced in the query processor by an over-normalized structure. Denormalization reduces the number of tables, and the complicated table joins because a higher number of joins can slow down the process.
  
  Normalization and denormalization are useful according to the situation. Normalization is used when the faster insertion, deletion and update anomalies, and data consistency are necessarily required. On the other hand, Denormalization is used when the faster search is more important and to optimize the read performance. It also lessens the overheads created by over-normalized data or complicated table joins.
